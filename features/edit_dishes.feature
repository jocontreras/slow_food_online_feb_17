Feature: Edit dishes on menu
  As a restaurant owner
  In order to manage my menu
  I would like to be able to edit dishes on my menu

  Background:

    | name        |
    | NisseKebbab |
    | AmberBurger |
   Given the following menus exist

   Scenario: I succesfully edit the dish

    When I fill in "dish_name" with "Felafelrulle"
    Then I click "Save"
    Then I should see "Felafelrulle details successfully changed"
    And the dish name in the system should now be "Felafelrulle"
